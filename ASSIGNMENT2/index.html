                    <li>travel around the world.</li>
                    <li>do some video editing.</li>
                </ul>

                   I think we can change the color of the comment for the VOD,like, the more upvote <br>the comment gets, the more significant color can the comment can have.
                   As far as I know, <br>there are a lot of frameworks for JavaScript, so that it should not be so difficult
                   to achieve this.
